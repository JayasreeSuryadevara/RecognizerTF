# Download and Installation
	Download the package and copy the path to index.html and run it on your browser

# Image Recognition
	Process to train the computer to recognize images
	using observations about the images and processing them

# TensorflowJS
	Machine Learning Library for JavaScript Developers.

# Mobilenet
	Convolutional Neural Network library for Image classification

# KNN Classifier
	Nearest Neighbor Classifier to find the best possible prediction
	addExample() adds a new object and observations to the classifier
	predictClass() will predict the outcome using K-nearest neighbors algorithm.

# Usage
	Drag any image from your computer and drop it onto the canvas
	Label the image using the input field and clicking the Learn button
	Try to drag more images on to the canvas and labeling them.
	Once an image is labeled you can find the classifier identifying the image 
	The probability of the prediction is also shown to the user.
